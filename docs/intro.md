# Introduction

Welcome to my personal documentation repository for learning Laravel! Let's briefly discuss its structure, content and purpose.

## Structure & Navigation

On this site you will find a comprehensive collection of notes, insights, and tutorials that I've gathered while diving into the world of Laravel development.

The documentation is organized into several sections, each of which is dedicated to a specific topic or aspect of Laravel. You can navigate through the documentation using the sidebar on the left.

## What is it for?

The main purpose of this documentation is to serve as a reference for myself, and to help me remember the things I've learned. However, I've decided to make it public in case it might be useful to someone else.
