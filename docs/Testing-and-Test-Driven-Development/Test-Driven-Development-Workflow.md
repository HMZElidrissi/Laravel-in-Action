# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code is implemented. The TDD workflow follows a simple and iterative process that helps ensure the quality and correctness of the code. TDD is widely used in Agile development methodologies and has become a fundamental practice for many software development teams. Letâ€™s explore the steps of the TDD workflow.

## Write a Test

The first step in the TDD workflow is to write a test that defines the behavior you want to implement. This test should be written before any code is written and should fail initially since the code to implement the behavior does not exist yet.

In TDD, a test should be concise and specific and address a single requirement. The test should be a small and focused unit test or feature test, depending on the scope of the functionality being tested.

```php title="tests/Unit/CalculatorTest.php"

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use App\Calculator;

class CalculatorTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testAdd()
    {
        $calculator = new Calculator();
        $result = $calculator->add(2, 3);
        $this->assertEquals(5, $result);
    }
}
```

## Run the Test

After writing the test, you run the test suite to execute all the tests, including the new test you just created. Since the code to satisfy the test has not been implemented yet, the test will fail. This failure serves as a reminder that the functionality is not yet implemented and motivates you to write the code to make it pass.

## Write the Code

With the failing test in place, you start writing the code to implement the functionality needed to make the test pass. The primary goal at this stage is to write the simplest code necessary to pass the test. This approach keeps the code focused and minimizes the risk of over-engineering.

The code may not be the most optimized or complete solution at this point, but it should be enough to satisfy the test case you wrote earlier.

## Run the Test Again

Once you have written the code, you run the test suite again. This time, the test you created earlier should pass because the code you wrote fulfills the requirements of the test.

If the test passes, you can move on to the next step. If the test fails, you need to revisit the code and make the necessary adjustments until the test passes.

## Refactor the Code (Optional)

After the test passes, you can refactor the code to improve its design, readability, and performance. Refactoring is an essential step in the TDD workflow to ensure that the code remains clean and maintainable.

During refactoring, you can make changes to the code structure, variable names, method names, and other aspects of the codebase without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve the code quality without introducing new bugs.

## Repeat the Cycle

The TDD workflow is an iterative process that involves writing tests, implementing code, and refactoring in small, incremental steps. You repeat this cycle for each new feature or functionality you want to add to your application.
